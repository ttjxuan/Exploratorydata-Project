# Exploratorydata-Project

This is a readme file including the explanation of my code.

For the first question, I read all the files and use rbind and add row names for x and y for the matched activity label (which is also reuqired for question 3 and 4)
I use the expression given in lesson week 4 to solve question 2
Then I use aggregate for the question five 
I write it in my folder and upload it as attached.
